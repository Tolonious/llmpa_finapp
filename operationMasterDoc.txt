Technology Stack: Choose the programming languages, frameworks, and databases that you plan to use based on your comfort level and the requirements of the project. Given your familiarity with Python, JavaScript, etc., you could consider the following:

	Front-end: React
	Back-end: Python and C++
	Database: PostgreSQL
	
Version Control: Set up a GitHub repository to manage the code for your project. This will allow you to track changes, collaborate with others if needed, and maintain different versions of the application:
	
	GitHub
	
Development Environment: Use Visual Studio Code or a similar IDE for writing and testing your code. Ensure that you have the necessary extensions and setup for the languages and frameworks you've chosen:
	
	VS Code
	
Prototype and MVP: Start by creating wireframes or mock-ups of your application's user interface. Then, develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the core functionalities that are most important:
	
	Figma
	Adobe Creative Cloud
	
Local Development: Set up your local development environment to start coding the application. This step may include installing necessary libraries, frameworks, and development tools.
	
Cloud Services and Hosting: Decide whether you want to deploy your application on cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud or if you'd prefer hosting it locally to begin with. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes can help in creating a scalable production environment.
	
	Docker
	
Security and Privacy: Since the application will handle sensitive financial information, ensure that you implement strong authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and comply with privacy laws and regulations.

Testing: Regularly test your application for functionality, security, and usability. Automated tests can help you maintain code quality throughout development.

Documentation and Maintenance: Document your code and application setup to make it easier for future maintenance or contributions by others.
